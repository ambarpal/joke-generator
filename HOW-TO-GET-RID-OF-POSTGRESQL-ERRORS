1. Postgresql is a complete noob, it does not know anything.. anything.
2. First of all set all permissions(md5/peer) in /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf to trust
3. Then take full rights by sudo chmod 777 /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf
4. Go to superuser mode with postgres as alias: sudo su - postgres
5. Run: psql
6. Now issue the command: create role "joke-generator" superuser with login;
7. Again, psql is noob, YOU NEED TO PUT THE SEMICOLON AT THE END FOR THE THING TO GET EXECUTED.
8. Check with \du; to ensure that the user is added happily.
9. Now run rake db:create to create all the required databases.
10. ENJOY AND DROP ME A THANKYOU MAIL. I SPENT 2 HRS TRYING TO DECIPHER THIS. I FEEL DIZZY.
